# dok

dok turns any server in a Platform as a Service. 
It allows you to deploy your apps using just git-push and Docker.

It is based on Docker, bash, git, ssh and driven by simplicity of the architecture, to support ease of use and ease of customization. 

The only dependencies you need on your linux server are git and Docker, that's it!
